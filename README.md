## Governify specific configuration

This application has been developed to be used within the Governify framework. In order to do so, some Governify-specific tool like ***Bluejay*** must be deployed in the same server as the TPA Designer.

The following table shows the tools that must be deployed and the corresponding environment variables that must be set in the TPA Designer.

| Tool | Environment variable  | Default value | Example value |
| ---- | --------------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| TPA Designer | - |  http://localhost:5173 | https://designer.bluejay.governify.io |
| ASSETS_MANAGER_URL | process.env.ASSETS_MANAGER_URL | http://localhost:5200 | https://assets.bluejay.governify.io/ |
| REGISTRY_URL | process.env.REGISTRY_URL | http://localhost:5400 | https://registry.bluejay.governify.io/ |
| SCOPE_MANAGER_URL | process.env.SCOPE_MANAGER_URL | http://localhost:5700 | https://scopes.bluejay.governify.io |

There are two ways to set the environment variables:

1. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and set the variables there. The file should look like this:

```
ASSETS_MANAGER_URL=https://assets.bluejay.governify.io/
REGISTRY_URL=https://registry.bluejay.governify.io/
SCOPE_MANAGER_URL=https://scopes.bluejay.governify.io
```

2. Set the environment variables in the server where the TPA Designer is deployed.

In the `/src/stores/tpaEdition.js` file, there are some variables that hold the enumerated values for the different options that can be selected in the edition mode of the app. These variables are used to populate the dropdowns in the TPA Designer, among other things. The values of these variables can be modified to add new types to the dropdowns. The variables are: 

- `BLOCK_TYPES`
- `COLLECTOR_EVENT_SOURCES`
- `COLLECTOR_EVENT_ENDPOINTS`
- `STEP_TYPES`
- `WINDOW_PERIOD_OPTIONS`
